# UNNAMED VOLUMES:

# If u create a container for that container docker is creating temporary volumes inside 

# /var/lib/docker/overlay2/container_id path.

# And if u delete the container this temporary volume gets deleted.

# docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /home/centos/nginx-data:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

# docker exec it container_id bash

# cd /usr/share/nginx/html

# echo "hello-docker" > hello.html

# exit

# cd nginx-data

# echo "volumes-data" > volume.html

# ls -l 

# In this folder u should find the both files hello.html and volume.html

# Delete the container still we can see the files present nginx-data folder.

# And create another nginx container and attach this volume to this container.

# docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /home/centos/nginx-data:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

# access the nginx server in browser with ip:8080/hello.html


# NAMED VOLUMES:

# docker volume create nginx

# /var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx/_data --> named volumes path

# named volumes can be managed with docker commands.

# now instead of creating directory and mounting it on the container we can attach the created volume directly

# to the container.

# docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v nginx:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

# docker exec -it 7a1c4e1fd2db bash

# cd /usr/share/nginx/html

# echo "hello named volumes" > hi.html

# exit

# sudo -i

# cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx/_data

# ls -l ; the above created file should be present.

# delete the container and go to /var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx/_data path, file should be present.
