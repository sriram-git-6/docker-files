In Docker, a multi-stage build is a feature that allows you to use multiple FROM statements in your 

dockerfile. Each FROM statement represents a different build stage, and you can copy artifacts from one stage 

to another. This helps in creating smaller and more efficient Docker images.

# First stage: Build stage
FROM node:14 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Second stage: Production-ready image
FROM nginx:alpine
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY --from=builder /app/dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html
